# one2onetool

I have used github actions to create a workflow. Release branch has environment variable "DATA_FILE" and staging branch does not have it. email will be sent out after the job completion with the status. codeql has been used for verifying the quality of the code after which the build will start.
after triggering the work flow from github actions, deployment completed successfully and services tested with loadbalancer dns and port number 3000.
